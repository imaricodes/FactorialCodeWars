codeWars practice kata: Factorial

Instructions:
Write a function to calculate factorial for a given input. If input is below 0 or above 12 throw an exception of type ArgumentOutOfRangeException (C#) 

I could do this using a for loop, but from recent experience, I will try this using the Enumerable class and Linq.

Procedure:

1. Input is validated. If not valid, throw and out of range exception (try catch?) If input is 0, bypass step two and output 1
2. Select each number in range of 0 - n + 1 ( +1 includes the top of the range). I think this is a select method in the enumerable class?
	*no sorting needed because... multiplication
3. Multiply the items in the selected range. This is the factorial
4.
